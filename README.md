# Mock Bitcoin Cash oracle message generator

Visit the [live demo](https://mock-oracle-messages.netlify.app/)

A minimal React + TypeScript interface for generating mock oracle messages. This tool is intended for testing or learning purposes when working with Bitcoin Cash smart contracts.

This project is a fork of the original oracle message generator by [mrZwets](https://github.com/mr-zwets/oracleMessage). It provides a simple web interface, allowing you to quickly and easily generate and copy mock oracle messages from the browser for use in the [Cashscript Playground](https://playground.cashscript.org/) or in your smart contract tests.

#### Why use React for such a simple app?

I chose React because even though the interface is minimal now, it lets me add any future BCH smart-contract utilities as new components, keeping everything together in one repo.

The current UI is minimal. It was designed quickly just to get things working. If more utilities get added and this repo grows into a more useful app, Iâ€™ll improve the UI/UX. For now, it is what it is.
